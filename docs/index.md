Some of the most significant challenges for a new learner in the subject are getting frustrated with development of the website and being hard on yourself if you cannot get a concept right away. Some advantages that I associate with one method over the other are that one of the website developers is more user-friendly and doesnâ€™t require as much computer coding knowledge compared to the other that requires a lot of coding knowledge. Some of the challenges that there are in learning how to modify the layout and/ or organization of each site include understanding consumer behavior, coding of the site and understanding HTML and CSS. Some skills necessary to learn and develop these sites in either format are general knowledge about computers, consumer behavior, digital media and file management and content creation. Some skills that I think I want to learn to improve this website include engagement.
